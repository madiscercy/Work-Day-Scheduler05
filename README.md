# Work Day Scheduler
## By Madison Scercy
This project is a work day scheduler. At the top you will see the date, followed by hour blocks that you can type text into. The gray blocks indicate past, red is present, and green is future hours. You can type into them and save that text with the save button on the right, and the text will persist. This project wouldn't be possible with the help of my tutor Faran Navazi, much thanks and credit to him.
